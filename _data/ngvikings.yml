  We're happy to announce the diversity support program! ngVikings participants can donate a ticket to help us get

  name: "Jamie"
  surname: "González García"
  bio: "<p>Hi! I am Jaime González García and I am a full stack web developer and UX designer.
  During the past few years of my career I have been slowly but surely specializing in front-end development and user
  experience, and somewhere and some time along the way I fell in love with JavaScript.
  I still enjoy developing in the full stack though, bringing ideas to life,
  building things from nothingness, beautiful things that are a pleasure and a delight to use.</p>

<p><b>I want to <a href='https://vimeo.com/98720197' target='_blank'>make the world a better place</a> through building
 awesome software.</b> I haven’t figured out how exactly to do that just yet… so I am getting by with
 <a href='http://www.jaimegonzalezgarcia.com/' target='_blank'>building meaningful products that help people</a>,
 <a href='http://www.google.se/' target='_blank'>working as a technical solutions consultant at Google and helping my publishers be great</a>,
 <a href='http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/' target='_blank'>teaching and sharing what I know</a>,
 and at a smaller scale by being kind to those around me, joyful and funny :).</p>

<p>I live in Sweden with my beautiful fiancée Malin and devote my hours to writing software,
 reading a ton, writing, drawing and lifting heavy weights.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to teaching the awesomeness of programming Angular to more people at ngGirls and increase the
diversity of our awesome community! Yey!</p>

  name: "Simona"
  surname: "Cotin"
  bio: "<p>I fell in love with programming while I was being tutored to pass the programming in C++ class.
  That was 15 years ago. Ever since I have  coded in C++, Java, C#, Delphi, Python, PHP, Lisp,
  Javascript and hoping to learn Go this year.</p>

  <p>I am a self thought Angular developer with nearly 4 years experience.
  Angular was love at first sight giving a complete new meaning to the Javascript world,
  thanks to Kent Dodds and <a href='http://egghead.io' target='_blank'>egghead.io</a> - that's where I got hooked on Angular.</p>

  <p>Looking forward to sharing the passion and knowledge with ngGirls &hearts;!</p>

  name: "Martin"
  surname: "Hobert"
  bio: "<p>I’m at 26-year-old developer currently working at Mindworking A/S where I develop websites and solutions
  for real estate agencies. I’ve had my own web agency for 4 years where we created websites for all kinds of companies.
  I’ve recently sparked my attention with Single Page Applications and got to create my very first Angular 2 web app
  together with the WordPress REST API to create a website for a physiotherapist
  (<a href='https://kuhrefysio.dk/' target='_blank'>kuhrefysio.dk</a>).
  Since then I’ve started several small and big projects with most of them either based on Angular 2 or React,
  some of them being web applications while others are mobile.</p>

  <p>I love learning and playing with new toys which is why my boss hates/loves me as I’m that guy who
  always comes about and want to try out the next cool thing on the block!
  When I’m not coding I’m usually gaming or sleeping.</p>

  name: "Sebastian"
  surname: "Florian"
  bio: "<p>I started programming around age 15, got interested in design,
  internet of things, electronics, engineering, worked in a few startups and projects,
   currently playing around at Falcon.io where I am a senior frontend developer.
   Been working with angular for almost 3 years. </p>

  <p>I loved Angular at first sight, and have been really lucky to have had a great mentor myself when I started.
  I know sometimes the world of programming can look intimidating, and a bit like a man's world,
  but it's actually something very creative and personal, and the more diverse and different ways of viewing a problem,
  the better. </p>

  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>
