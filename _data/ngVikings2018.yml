  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  title: "&nbsp;"
  company: "Organizer"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>

</p><p>
I started learning Angular thanks to my own mentor’s advice, so I know how much positive impact a mentor can have on someone’s life. As a mentor at ngGirls, I would love to help others figure out if learning Angular is the right path for them.
</p><p>
As a woman in tech, I understand how intimidating it can be to start a tech career. Helping other women improve their technical skills and growing their self-confidence means a lot to me.

  bio: "<p>I'm Sebastian, a 29 year old front-end engineer working in Copenhagen, DK
</p><p>
I think programming is rapidly becoming a required tool in everyday life, and one of the most satisfying things you can do with this tool is web development. Immediate feedback, quick prototyping and great frameworks make it a great choice for beginners as well. 
</p><p>
I mentor for some great organizations in Copenhagen, and have mentored for ngGirls in the past, and I think it's an important initiative to tackle the unjustified imbalance in the tech world.
</p><p>
Outside of that, I try to travel as often as possible, bad puns, and since I have no musical talents, just started taking piano lessons.
