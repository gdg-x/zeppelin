  company: "ngGirls"
  title: "Web Developer and Consultant, Founder"
  description: "In July 2014 I've been chosen to participate in Django Girls Berlin, as part of Europe's PyConf. I had just finished my M.Sc. and was thinking about the future. Although I've had programming experience, this event inspired me to explore the world of development, and especially Web development, even deeper, and join the Tech industry. Today I am ready to give back. So not with Django, but with Angular, which I really love."
  bio: "Shmuela Jacobs is a front-end developer and consultant mastering Angular. During her academic studies (M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering and B.Sc. in Physics) she has combined her passions of coding and teaching as a software developer, teaching assistant, science museum guide, and researcher. Today she continues to enjoy these activities as a full-time developer, sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups and conferences around the world."

  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>

  name: "David"
  surname: "Losert"
  company: "&nbsp;"
  bio: "<p>I'm 29 years old web developer living in Munich - but my roots and my heart still lie somewhere in the Black Forest near Freiburg. I am working at Virtual Identity since 2013 mostly with JavaScript and Typescript. I have worked a lot with Angular & Angular2 in the past - these days I mostly work with react & redux.</p>  
<p>When I moved to Munich 2 years ago, I soon discovered the power of developer communities in meetups and conferences. I was stunned on how much I could learn and grow by so many people who were willing to share their knowledge, opinions, wisdom and, most importantly, their perspectives. I soon wanted to give back to those communities and enable others to experience the same, and so I started to host meetups myself as well as helping organize an annual unconference: the JSCraftCamp (http://jscraftcamp.org)</p>
<p>As organizer of those events I realized fast that  a lot of times, the audience is not very diverse. I think this is very sad as the real power and potential of those events is - as I mentioned - the different perspectives which you only get WITH diversity.</p>
<p>Therefore my motivation on being a Mentor to ngGirls is to hopefully help growing a more diverse developers community in which everybody can learn and grow by sharing my experience and giving the participants a save and easy access to web development. And I am sure that I will have the opportunity to learn so much FROM the participants as well.</p>"
