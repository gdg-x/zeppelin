In my free time, I enjoy dance and travel.</p>"

  bio: "<p>I have been programming for 45 years - since I was in High School and still love it. I learn something new every day and enjoy solving problems. It has always bothered me that there are so few women in programming and lately have been taking on mentoring roles when I can. I volunteered with TEALS, worked as a mentor with Thinkful, taught with Kids Code at a local elementary school and most recently attended a SheTech Explorer Day as a mentor for their technical challenge. My current job is at Health Catalyst where I have been doing mainly front end work with Angular and mentoring up and coming software engineers. I am the wife of another software developer and the mother of three more. I am the grandmother of two year old twins and can't wait to see what they will achieve!

For the last several years, he’s served as a consultant, trainer, and senior software developer for organizations large and small all across the US. These days, he divides his time between building large, complex web applications, and teaching other people how to build large, complex web applications. He feels weird writing about himself in the third person.
