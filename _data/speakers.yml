  bio: "Nickolas Means loves nothing more than a story of engineering triumph (except maybe a story of engineering disaster). When he's not stuck in a Wikipedia loop reading about plane crashes, he's a Senior Engineering Manager at GitHub working on secure coding and dependency management tools. He works remotely from Austin, TX, and spends his spare time hanging out with his wife and kids, going on runs, and trying to brew the perfect cup of coffee."
