  company: "Stickman Ventures, Inc."
  title: "I build and hack on just about anything"
  bio: '#glassexplorer currently writing a book on Glassware / GDK development. My lovely wife Monica keeps me sane. She has to because we have three girls (the oldest Alli, and the new twins, Isabella and Evelyn). I started a company called Stickman Ventures, Inc back in 2007 with Gareth Coen. Still going strong. And no, we’re not a startup. We’re a business! I heart the hacking. I will hack pretty much anything that interests me. Code, hardware, house, car, kids toys…I don’t care.'
