  title: "Effective and Efficient Load and Performance Testing"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">To often load and performance testing for our application is put aside up till the last minute wherein issues are now harder and more expensive to fix. In this talk, I will go through the process my team implements to catch performance issues as early as possible."

  title: "Scavenging the Mailbox: Automating Email Verifications"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Test automation engineers have encountered numerous headaches in dealing with testing email verifications.
                <br><br>
                Some test automation engineers have been caught in snare where they tackled the problem using email retrieval via REST APIs like Mailosaur and GMail. However, this approach made the automation engineers dependent on the webmail provider. Furthermore, if the APIs of these webmail providers change, though very seldom, automation engineers need to adjust their scripts. Moreover, usage of Mailosaur API comes with a cost. To make things worst, I’ve seen automation engineers relying on Selenium to scrape the emails; which is very time expensive and very brittle.
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, the best efficient approach to this problem is to observe how our email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird and other Android email clients seamlessly fetch our emails across various webmail providers - which is via IMAP(S). This presentation will talk about the whats and the hows of automating email verifications using IMAP(S), more specifically using Robot Framework’s IMAP Library."

  title: "Surviving a Paranoid Girlfriend: Automating SMS Interactions"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Test automation engineers have encountered numerous headaches in dealing with automating SMS interactions.
                <br><br>
                Some test automation engineers have been caught in snare where they tackled the problem using the mmssms.db database file of a rooted Android device. Some uses CodeOn’s SMS Gateway API which requires an Internet connectivity to access their server. Some uses paid version of third party SMS Gateway APIs like Twilio. To make things worst, I’ve seen some automation engineers relying on Appium to scrape the SMS; which is very time expensive and very brittle.
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, the best efficient approach to this problem is to exploit the Perfness’s REST SMS Gateway Android app. This app does not require rooted Android device, Internet connectivity, money, nor being UI-dependent. This presentation will talk about the whats and the hows of automating, both sending and receiving, SMS using the aforementioned Android app and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB)."

  title: "Complexity, Testing Without Testers, and the Future of Software Testing"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Complexity science informs us why there is a massive-progressive paradigm shift in software testing: favorability of automation, QA commodification, obsolescence of specialist testers, and devops-ification of QE (and why your ISTQB certification is useless).
                <br><br>
                The reason? Humanity’s ruthless quest to reduce uncertainty.
                <br><br>
                In this talk I’ll share how we built a high-quality digital bank without dedicated testers, and what it means to the future of software testing."

  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Adversary Emulation System is an emerging automation practice in the information security field to test different attack scenarios inside our computers and see its effects from an adversarial point of view.
                In this talk an opensource tool will be introduced called Caldera.
                Specifically,  different attack combinations will be emulated in real time through a trojan attack on multiple virtual machines."

  description: "<p align=\"justify\">As many companies continue to embrace automation, it’s easy to fall into the trap of doing automation for the sake of automating. In this topic, the speaker will talk about tools and techniques on how to build an effective test automation framework that can be used by applications built through RESTful APIs, how to integrate automated testing into DevOps, how to conduct in-sprint automation for continuous testing across the enterprise; and test automation mistakes that need to be avoided."
