  descriptions: ["Techniques for Software Testing Optimization",
  "Are you doing software testing? And are you doing it optimizing your effort?",
  "In our days, the demanding to reduce the time to market is becoming almost insane. With the always increasing complexity (risk) of the systems at the same time that we have shorter development cycles (time) with the advent of the agile methodologies, software testers are always under pressure to ensure more quality with less effort (cost). Is it possible?",
  "Short answer: yes!",
  "In most of the cases, yes, it is possible. However, the solution is rarely to reduce the testing effort. Instead, you should focus on how to optimize it (delivering more value with the same effort it’s also a way to reduce costs)! In this workshop, we will discuss the main points of waste in the testing activities and put in practice several techniques (and advices) to help on reducing the waste while optimizing the effort.",
  "This is a practical workshop so you will need a white A4 page, a pencil (or pen) and a windows based laptop because besides the techniques, you will also install and learn how to use a simple web testing automation tool."]

  title: "Whole Team Quality: In the same boat or up the creek?"
  descriptions: ["Those three little words. No, not those three, the other three: “Whole Team Quality”.",
  "We know that successful agile teams live and breathe by this principle. But what does it actually mean in practice – and what does it not definitely not mean?",
  "In this keynote, I’ll look at techniques teams can use to evolve their testers and developers and to empower the team to (want to) be responsible for quality together – without suggesting that what we really need is just a great super role that can do everything. I’ll tell some stories about things that have and haven’t worked and I’ll address some of the questions and fears that come up when we talk about whole team quality."]
