  title: "The Dirty Dozen - A proven model of human error that can help you reduce cyber risk"
  description: "The Dirty Dozen refers to twelve of the most common human error preconditions, or conditions that can act as precursors, to accidents or incidents, in the aviation industry. Developed by Canadian Gordon Dupont, it became the cornerstone of the aviation industry's Human Factors safety program in the 1990s. That program was a major part of reducing incidents per million departures from 4.0 to less than .5 over the past 30 years, a nearly 90% reduction. In this talk, David will discuss the Dirty Dozen and how they can be applied to cybersecurity to significantly improve awareness programs and reduce cyber risk. "

  title: "Threat hunting via DNS"
  description: "DNS logs are one of the most powerful threat hunting resources, but encryption is rapidly changing that equation.
Key DNS threat hunting techniques include detecting DNS tunneling and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). It used to be simple(r): log DNS requests and responses on DNS forwarders, or sniff and analyze via tools like Zeek. 
DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) are disrupting the status quo: where does that leave network defenders? This talk will analyze the current state of DNS monitoring, and provide actionable steps for detecting malice on your network via DNS."

  title: "Purple is the new black: Modern Approaches to Application Security"
  description: "Gone are the days when breaches were rare and security could safely be put low on the priority list; product security is now a customer demand and cyber crime has reached epic proportions. Our idolization of hackers, penetration testing and ‘breaking’ has not resulted in secure software for our industry, only egos, stereotypes and unaffordable security models. Modern application security approaches are needed for new technologies, and this talk will outline several strategies for new tech, one by one. The future of security is PURPLE."
