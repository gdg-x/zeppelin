                will show how imagery and the new framework material rendering can make apps
                more interesting and communicate more quickly."

  description: "Google has 1M APIs and services. Every API is different! Learn
                how you can interact with Google services without writing code! Designing
                your UI so it works across multiple screen sizes is no longer a nice to have,
                it is *the* way to build for the web. Using Polymer, we'll cover how to
                create robust, responsive elements that work across all platforms."
