  title: "TeSTO: Techniques for Software Testing Optimization"
  soldout: true
  descriptions: ["Are you doing software testing? And are you doing it optimizing your effort?",
  "In our days, the demanding to reduce the time to market is becoming almost insane. With the always increasing complexity (risk) of the systems at the same time that we have shorter development cycles (time) with the advent of the agile methodologies, software testers are always under pressure to ensure more quality with less effort (cost). Is it possible?",
  "Short answer: yes!",
  "In most of the cases, yes, it is possible. However, the solution is rarely to reduce the testing effort. Instead, you should focus on how to optimize it (delivering more value with the same effort it’s also a way to reduce costs)! In this workshop, we will discuss the main points of waste in the testing activities and put in practice several techniques (and advices) to help on reducing the waste while optimizing the effort.",
  "This is a practical workshop so you will need a white A4 page, a pencil (or pen) and a windows based laptop because besides the techniques, you will also install and learn how to use a simple web testing automation tool."]

  title: "Leadership for testers in agile teams"
  descriptions: ["The role of a tester on an agile team is so much more than “hey can you test this with your super testing skills”.",
  "Testers are, on the one hand, chameleons who need to adapt their skills to new situations within the team. On the other hand, we can’t just react to situations – we need to lead the team, other testers, product owners and customers towards better quality.",
  "Yet agile teams don’t generally bestow formal authority. And, as testers, we’re often trying to lead from a position that is still not always appreciated (“agile teams don’t need testers”, “testers are just bad developers”, “you’re just a tester”…).",
  "In complex situations where we’re dealing with unknown unknowns plus sticky, messy humans, communication is key. A degree in psychology would sometimes be helpful. Multiple years of cat-herding too. In this workshop, Alex will focus on communication.",
  "The workshop will consist of the following topics:",
  "<ul><li>Communicating the value and role of testing</li>",
  "<li>Testers as the communication glue for various stakeholders and within the team: talking about testing, risk and quality at the right level for the right audience</li>",
  "<li>Enablement: Teaching, coaching, coercing and encouraging others within the team to take on quality-related tasks and to support the value of the product through testing</li>",
  "<li>What testers and other team members can do together, resulting in better and more efficient results</li></ul>"]

  #"We know that successful agile teams live and breathe by this principle. But what does it actually mean in practice – and what does it not definitely not mean?",
  #"In this keynote, I’ll look at techniques teams can use to evolve their testers and developers and to empower the team to (want to) be responsible for quality together – without suggesting that what we really need is just a great super role that can do everything. I’ll tell some stories about things that have and haven’t worked and I’ll address some of the questions and fears that come up when we talk about whole team quality."]
