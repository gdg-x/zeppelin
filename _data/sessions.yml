  description: "Purpose comes in all sizes, big and small. My small purpose is to get through delivering this talk without embarrassing myself. My big purpose is to help as many people as I can in small ways every day. Notice I said small ways. Why small ways? Because the biggest moments in life tend to happen on the way to your plans. Think about the most significant moments in your life. The pivotal points that changed everything. If you’ve ever fallen in love, there’s a good chance that you never planned for it to happen on the day it did. And later... if it didn’t work out, I bet you didn’t plan that either. This is not to discount plans or goals. I firmly believe in having a plan and setting a destination before you embark on your journey. Goals are necessary. Sort of like the bread on a sandwich. The goals hold it all together but the best parts are of the the middle."

    Did you ever notice that there’s no “fun” in Object-Oriented or Protocol-Oriented programming but that functional programming starts with "fun"? In this fast-paced talk we don’t emphasize functional programming because it’s good for you - we look at games and puzzles that go back nearly one hundred years to the invention of combinators. Don’t worry, we’ll get to the useful application part at the end - but let’s begin by just playing.
  outcome: |
   - The foundations of functional programming
   - The techniques of modern day functional programming in these ideas from logic
   - The benefits of using a combinator approach for smoothing and describing some of the flow of logic and control in your applications

  title: "The Reactive Code That Broke My Brain and Changed My Mind (just in time for Combine)"
  description: |
   After almost five years of working with ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift, I still felt like reactive (Rx) programming had limited use in my work. But with Swift and RxSwift maturing, I was looking for a way to try it more.

   This spring, a colleague and I decided to use it whole-heartedly on a project. We established some guidelines that led us to an extremely clean Model-View-ViewModel implementation with a declarative ViewController and stateless ViewModel.

   And when Apple announced Combine at WWDC this year, we were glad we did because this code will convert to SwiftUI/Combine more easily.

   To start, I’ll cover the basic ideas of Rx (RxSwift and Combine). But this talk is less about Rx operators and more about how to use Rx to build a reactive architecture.

   I’ll show some code from two apps—Trello (RxSwift) and a new workout app I’m working on (Combine).

   If you have no Rx experience, in this session I hope to show you some motivating examples that might convince you to give it a try.

   If you’re using Rx, I want to show you some techniques for using it to make MVVM structures that are more testable and easier to maintain.
  outcome: |
   - The basic ideas behind Rx that all Rx libraries share
   - The "why" for Rx style code 1) how it can be radically different from typical Objected-Oriented structures
   - How to do Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) with Rx
     1) a stateless/pure-functional ViewModel;
     2) a more declarative View/ViewController
   - How to unit test the resulting ViewModel

  title: "Straying From the Happy Path: Taking Control of Errors in Swift"
  description: |
   Have you ever seen a code comment saying “this should never happen”? Have you ever wondered what would happen if it did? Swift has a diverse set of error-handling capabilities, from using `throw` to send errors up the stack to using a `Result` to handle errors in asynchronous methods. In this talk, we’ll look at the landscape of handling errors in Swift, create new ways of expressing and handling them, and show how even the most impossible code-level situations can have 100% test coverage.
  outcome: |
   Spanning the history of error handling from Objective-C to Combine and SwiftUI, this talk will help you better handle errors in your code, test error-handling code paths, and log errors easily and conveniently. You’ll understand not only how to achieve test coverage of your code’s error paths, but also which tests are important to write to understand your error paths.

  title: "To the Core of Core NFC"
  description: |
   NFC has been around for a while and we use it every day in things like Apple Pay but how does it work and what features are actually available for developers to use? Until recently NFC was pretty limited on iOS and devs used to struggle to find use cases they could implement in their apps. NFC itself has plenty of applications but we were not able to take full advantage of them because of these limitations but now that Apple has announced tag writing support, the game completely changes. Some of your Android friends might tell you: “Well we have had that for a long time!” and yeah it’s true, but without Apple opening their APIs it was hard for companies to find a compelling case to build apps where only one platform was going to be supported.


   In this talk, you will learn the basics of Near Field Communication such as tagging, different technologies, and specifications. We will also take a peak to these new features and implement some of them in a quick example and other possible applications.


   Join me to see why I think learning about the new Core NFC features are important and the long-lasting implications they will have around the world.

  outcome: |
   - Basics of Near Field communication and tagging, what is NFC? NDEF and the new supported specifications.
   - Basics of the new Core NFC features and an example of using these features to learn read and write from a tag.
   - The importance of the latest announcements and why these will have long-lasting implications around the world. Countries like Japan and Germany are already thinking to use this technology to convert their national IDs.

   Testing is critical, but can be difficult. In this talk we will explore using Swift’s protocol oriented programming for User Interface testing to create light-weight interfaces that are composed of user behavior and application state. We will discuss the pro’s and con’s of writing tests this way. We will also discuss options for further development of the technique. This talk isn’t just for testers. This talk is also for product managers, designers, developers, and customers! As a use case, will will walk through logging into and using a movie rating app. We will build up a protocol that allows tests to be read as a set of instructions for an actual user. When we are done, we will have a better understanding of behavior driven development, UI testing, and protocol oriented programming in Swift.

  title: "Protocol Oriented Programming"
  description: |
   They said Swift is “protocol oriented,” so you wrote protocols. But you wanted them to be generic, so you added associated types. But your collections broke, so you added type-erasers. But your “as”-casts broke, so you switched to Any. But then everything broke, so you read about Mirror. And the tears began. Why did it have to be so hard to make an array?

   It doesn’t have to be so hard. But it’s very easy to use the wrong tools to solve the wrong problems. In this session I’ll help you reevaluate what it means to write generic Swift and how to choose the right tools for the job. Whether your goal is reusable view controllers, flexible networking, data-driven UI, effective unit testing, or just the joy of elegant data structures, you’ll learn how to work with Swift and not fight the compiler.

   This talk assumes familiarity with Swift syntax for generics, protocols, extensions, enums, and first-class functions (such as completion handlers), as well as the basic differences between Swift structs and classes. More advanced topics, including protocols with associated types, enums with associated data, closures, and functions as return types, will be introduced and explained.
  outcome: |
    Attendees will learn how to develop generic and reusable code in Swift, starting from concrete implementations and finding the abstractions within. They will learn the vocabulary of generics, including existentials and the many kinds of type erasure. Finally, they will learn the many tools of generic Swift, including protocols, associated types, and generic structs, but also generic functions and most importantly composition of types and functions to make their code more flexible without making it more complex.

   We developers love building fully featured apps and we build them the best way we know; but sometimes this leads us to toil for too long on apps that could have succeeded just as well, with insanely less effort and time.

   For the next 25 minutes we ask: do apps need server backends to deliver content? How can apps succeed while missing important features? In this non-coding, product and customer oriented session, learn about the decision-making philosophy for the WeCroak app; an app that cut development corners, while still delivering a compelling user experience. The App uses an on-device content architecture that eschews a backend and lacked seemingly important features at launch. After the App went viral, how did this architecture and lack of features hold up?

  description: |
   Testing is hard.
   Talking about testing is hard.
   Being committed to testing feels exceptionally hard because it’s hard to do and hard to talk about.

   We oftentimes don’t have vocabulary for describing what were trying to do when we sit down to write test code, and as a community, we don’t discuss the ways in which we can make informed, strategic changes to our test suites as a result of our requirements and desired behavior. The vast opinions and many disparate sources on automated testing also don’t help us navigate this space.

   Based on his experiences engineering countless test suites, Sean Olszewski will outline the problems we have to solve when writing test code, how they differ from the problems you’re solving within your application, and what patterns and metrics exist to simplify and streamline test suite design.

   By the end of this presentation, you’ll have a better vocabulary for describing the fundamental and challenging problems that define automated testing. You’ll also be able to make more reasoned decisions about how you want to evolve your test suite by using patterns and metrics, which ultimately helps you have the utmost confidence in your tests while ensuring you’re still shipping frequently.

   After 18 years of ups and downs in the tech industry, Diana Rodriguez has seen good, bad and ugly. Leading worldwide community organisation for a non-profit has been an interesting experience where she found herself advocating for the exact same things she had to stand up for 18 years ago. In a sincere and honest talk about diversity, inclusion and evolution in the tech ecosystem, this isn't a SJW rant. It's an account of the mishaps of a woman in tech who decided to make a difference.
   (what do you reckon?)
