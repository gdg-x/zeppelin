  name: "Adrian"
  surname: "Ferreres"
  title: "Angular Developer"
  company: "GFT"
  bio: "<p>
    I'm Adrián Ferreres and asthma, star trek and video games (I'm not clear in what order) took me, at age 11, to start programming.
    Since then I have not stopped (from having asthma, watching star trek, playing video games and programming).
    In 2012 I left Java to start with JavaScript and I liked it ... a lot. I liked it so much that now I just do that.
    Since 2015, with the beta 17, I have been doing company projects in Angular. I am also the founder of ngLabs,
    a small community that collaborates with the meetup of AngularMadrid teaching how to code in Angular with Open Software projects.
    </p><p>
    The reason to participate in ngGirls is because the best way to improve as software developer is to help others.
    In this job, where everyone is, at the same time, teacher and student, the best way to be better professional
    (and better person) is to share knowledge to learn from the others.</p>

  title: "Cloud Developer Advocate"
  company: "Microsoft"
  bio: "<p>I fell in love with programming while I was being tutored to pass the programming in C++ class.
        That was 15 years ago. Ever since I have  coded in C++, Java, C#, Delphi, Python, PHP, Lisp,
        Javascript and hoping to learn Go this year.</p>

        <p>I am a self thought Angular developer with nearly 4 years experience.
        Angular was love at first sight giving a complete new meaning to the Javascript world,
        thanks to Kent Dodds and <a href='http://egghead.io' target='_blank'>egghead.io</a> - that's where I got hooked on Angular.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to sharing the passion and knowledge with ngGirls &hearts;!</p>

  title: "Front-end developer"
  company: "Briisk"
  bio: "<p>
    My name is Joanna and few years ago I graduated from Indian Studies. However, working only as Hindi language teacher
    and translator wasn't satisfying for me. This is why I tried few more jobs e.g. I worked as an account manager in a bank,
    then an analyst and IT consultant in international companies. About a year ago I decided to start learning programming.
    Today I work as a front-end developer at briisk.co. I like learning coding and I believe that we should encourage
    more girls to do so, that's why I want to take part in ngGirls. In my free time I love to read books, travel and practice yoga.

  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  title: "Frontend Dev"
  company: "STRATO"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
         (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
         impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
         So it is important to support them.</p>
         <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
         <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
         <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
         in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
         it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.

  I want to take part in ngGirls, because I think it's a brilliant idea - there are still definitely too little female

  knowledge with others.
