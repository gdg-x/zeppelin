     <p><b><a href='http://www.futurecoders.org.uk/' target='_blank'>futureCodersSE</a>
      is a non-profit aiming to help to build a community of young software developers.</b>
      They do this through an end-to-end process –
      <ul>
          <li>inspire young people to want to prepare for a career in development by organising careers
          events, hackathons, visits to businesses and to industry events</li>

          <li>run coding workshops where young people can learn from scratch and can build their skills</li>

          <li>run a work-experience programme where young people work in development teams 2 days per week for
          3 months or more, guided by volunteers and professional tech leads, practice Agile and Scrum,
           and deliver projects for charities,
          non-profits and social startups</li>
          <li>certificate participants from their work experience programme and work closely with employers
          to recommend young people for apprenticeships or junior positions.</li>
      </ul>

  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>
