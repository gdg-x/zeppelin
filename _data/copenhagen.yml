#  title: "Developer"
#  company: "Jolt"
#  bio: 	"<p>After studying media/visual arts and working as an English teacher and translator in Japan,
#  I got excited about the creative and collaborative opportunities tech opens up at the Tokyo Hackerspace
#  where members were using their knowledge to make (and program) incredible stuff and help others.
#  After moving back to the U.S., I studied coding on my own, with the help of programmer friends,
#  and through organizations like Girl Develop It to try to build a Japanese learning game.
#  To accelerate my progress and a career change, I enrolled in an after-work MEAN-stack web programming
#  course at Coding Campus (now V School). After successfully building the first version of the game for my
#  final project, I got my first programming job at Jolt (<a href='joltup.com' target='_blank'>joltup.com</a>),
#  a quickly-growing company that helps businesses organize operations and interact with their employees
#  more effectively.</p>
#  <p>I'm participating in ngGirls because I personally know how hard it is to be introduced to
#  programming--even in our Information Age--and how important mentorship is to bridging that gap.</p>"
