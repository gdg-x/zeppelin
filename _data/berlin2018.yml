- id: 1
  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>

  name: "Martin"
  surname: "Sonnenholzer"
  bio: "<p>I am an Angular developer, who started with version 1.0.7. A lot has happened in the Angular world since then.
  What stayed the same since the beginning was the awesome community. But we need more diversity to make it even better.
  So now it's my part to give back to the community.</p>

  name: "Feli"
  surname: "Kugland"
  bio: "<p>👩‍💻 I'm a Principal Product Engineer, working in Developer Relations at SinnerSchrader, based in Hamburg. I'm a developer since 13 years now.</p>
  <p>Start with developing on your own can be hard and frustrating 😤, to have mentors at your side 👯‍♀️ who support you can make it a lot easier 💡. 
  Also learning in a group can be a lot of fun 😄 and show you that everybody starts at some point 🏫.</p>
  <p>I want to show you start developing is no magic 🔮 and everyone can learn it 📚.
  So let's do it 💯, happy to be your mentor 💖</p>
