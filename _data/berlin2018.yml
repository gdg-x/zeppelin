  name: "Zahra"
  surname: "Joulaei"
  bio: "<p>I am master student of Web engineering in TUC (technische universität chemnitz), currently working as a front-end developer in Staffbase.
I am keen to be part of Start-ups and be in touch with people who has innovation and preseveerence on their goals.
When the Angularjs (v1) released, I was so happy that I am learning a new magic to impelement web apps in my company, but suddenly version2 came and ruined every dream I had and I started to learn it from base again😂 (because as you know there is a huge diffrence between angularjs and its version2 above).
The sad true part of learning code is that everybody knows that it is so damn hard! 😂
but if you just persist on learning, after a while you will feel some confident! but don't worry! this problem is so common, I still have so feelings of depression and hoplessness during struggling with codes 🤦🏼‍♀️ 
But remember that there is always a path... :) 
I am sure we will learn lots of things during this magical event.👩‍💻</p>

  <p>Start with developing on your own can be hard and frustrating 😤, to have mentors at your side 👯‍♀️ who support you can make it a lot easier 💡. 
  Also learning in a group can be a lot of fun 😄 and show you that everybody starts at some point 🏫.</p>
  <p>I want to show you start developing is no magic 🔮 and everyone can learn it 📚.
  So let's do it 💯, happy to be your mentor 💖</p>

  bio: "<p>I am an Angular developer, who started with version 1.0.7. A lot has happened in the Angular world since then.

  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>
