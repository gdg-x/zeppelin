  title: "QUALITY CHALLENGES IN DIGITALIZED WORLD – TESTING IS NEEDED"
  description:
    - "The world is more and more digitalized. There is the revolution of user experience including different mobile devices for connecting to internet. There is the changing business with more and more of the business becoming electronic, based on web services and automatic information sharing between different systems. Most recently there is the Internet of Things / Everything, connecting almost all industries into each other and/or their backend-systems."
    - "All the interconnectedness and increased demand on speed and ease-of-use suggests additional quality challenges. How can we ensure fast enough, secure and user-friendly information systems?"
    - "My opinion is that security testing, usability testing and performance testing become a greater focus. Additionally the way of creating software needs to become very quick and tuned to the feedback from user base. This means agile practices on both team level and organization level, DevOps, test automation, exploratory testing and broad competences on testing, software development, business domain knowledge and production environments. We need to be able to try easy and use that information to develop our software further."
    - "We all experience the changing world, where software takes a bigger role. The quality needs are understood on grass root level, in the lives of each of us, and we try different methodologies and tools to see which will solve the new quality."

  description:
    - "Businesses today must act with speed and agility, and in software development, this has fueled the rise of Agile methodologies, which embraces a continuous delivery process."
    - "For software testing, this means developers and testers seek to 'shift left,' and continuously test their applications much earlier in the application development lifecycle. But in today’s distributed environments ensuring continuity is a challenge."

  description:
    - "Start with a waterfallian, hierarchical, shrink-wrap software behemoth called Microsoft and grind it through product development practice modernization until it wakes up to the new Agile world. Add experimentation, embrace Open Source principles, change to a data-driven culture, and break up job roles and responsibilities. Stumble along the way, make mistakes, learn and measure as you go. Maybe you end up with a service that accumulates a few million users. This is the story of our journey to DevOps."

  description:
    - "A estratégia multicanal de uma empresa é chave para a sua transformação digital. Cada vez mais os utilizadores estão habituados a utilizar dispositivos móveis de forma constante para a realização de micro interacções através de apps ou sites. A estratégia de Testes deve garantir que todos os canais usados pelos utilizadores estão suficientemente testados para evitar que o benefício do imediatismo dado pelo multicanal represente um risco para a empresa."

  description:
    - "Layout testing has been historically considered to be something that cannot be automated. We will have a look on how this can be done and has been done in cross-browser compatibility area. Secondly, we’ll take a look to research results that compare the available methods to “the average tester”. We will show how high is the actual detection rate in manual/exploratory testing and how well do available automated methods compare?"
