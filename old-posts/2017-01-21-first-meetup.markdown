    <b>Join the first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ngGirls/events/236961755/" target="_blank">ngGirls meetup!</a> Monday, January 23rd, 2017, at BigPanda offices, Tel Aviv.</b>
    <br>It's open for everyone (including ngBoys :) ) and we're going to improve the tutorial used in ngGirls workshops (like NgGirls @ NgVikings).
    <br>Looking for people of all levels in Angular(2+) - beginners to follow and comment on the tutorial (and learn Angular on the way), and experienced Angularites to write the missing chapters from scratch.
    <br>Huge thanks to <a href="https://bigpanda.io/" target="_blank">BigPanda</a> for hosting us in their beautiful space!
