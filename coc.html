          ngGirls aims to be a welcoming event, where people meet in a friendly environment.
          Accordingly, we expect that all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other
          participants throughout the workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers
          at any ngGirls event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
          Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

        <h4>
          Longer Version
        </h4>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
            stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
            inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes
            can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate
            for ngGirls.</p>
          <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organizers may take any action
            they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.</p>
          <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all workshop venues and workshop-related social events.</p>
