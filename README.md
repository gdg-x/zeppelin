# DevOpsDays Sydney (Forked from Project Zeppelin)

### About

Project is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHub’s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Local development

Check if you have [all requirements for local environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
To install all development dependencies install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
```bash
    gem install bundler
```
and run next command from root folder:

```bash
  bundle install
```  

To start Jekyll run:
```bash
    jekyll serve -w
```
Site will be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ or http://localhost:4000/

**NOTE:** in this mode all changes to html and data files will be automatically regenerated, but after changing ```_config.yml``` you have to restart server.

### Resource optimizations (optional)

You can optimize images and minify css and javascript automatically (for now only on Windows).
But for Mac OS users available amazing tool - [imageoptim](https://imageoptim.com/). Thanks [@raphaelsavina](https://github.com/raphaelsavina) for link.
Optimize all images by running this script from `/automation/images/` folder:
```bash
    all_image_optimization.bat -d -jtran -pout -pquant -optip -gsicle -svgo
```

To minify CSS and JS run `minify_js.bat` (for Windows) and `minify_js.sh` (for Linux and MacOS) from `/automation/minifying/` folder:
```bash
    minify_js.bat
```

Learn more about available optimization options from [documentation](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin/wiki/Resources-optimizations).
