# About Block
aboutTitle: "25 Years of WABF"
aboutText: "Welcome!<br><br>Since the inaugural Wharton Africa Business Forum  (WABF), we have welcomed thought leaders, dignitaries, CEOs, captains of industry and young professionals from around the world to contemplate career leadership and champion Africa as a business destination. <strong>In this historic 25th Anniversary year, we are honored to be able to continue in this tradition.</strong><br><br>This year we have selected the theme <strong>“Continental Conversations: Choices for a New Africa”</strong> to facilitate dialogue about the complexity of investment and managerial decision-making by leaders in the midst of uncertainty, yet at the cusp of an unprecedented age of information, urbanization, technological connectivity, and its promises.  WABF25 hopes to distill the influences that have driven change in the past and that will drive change in the future.<br><br>Our goals for the 25th Forum are simple but bold: to provide unparalleled insights into the opportunities and challenges of operating in Africa; to connect young professionals with leaders in Africa’s public, private and social sectors; and to inspire educated talent in the Diaspora to get involved in the development of the continent.<br><br>We look forward to hosting you this November in Philadelphia.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Your WABF25 Leadership Team"
