    text: "Physical security is an essential part of overall security, and we've thoroughly enjoyed hosting virtual versions of BSides Halifax over the last few years. This year, BSides Halifax will be held at the Halifax Central Library, on May the 4th, 2023.
<br /><br />I'll give you a moment to get the jokes out of your system.
<br /><br />All good? Good. We're looking for your best talks about all aspects of security - blue team, red team, purple team, social engineering, that new tool you think everyone should know about, we want to hear about anything and everything you want to talk about.
<br /><br />We especially want to hear from underrepresented groups, on account of them being, you know, underrepresented. Studies show that specifically calling out folks who don't think a security conference is for them increases their likelihood of applying, so consider this your official \"This conference is for you!\" invitation.
<br /><br />Our CFP link can be found here: (link), the deadline is (deadline).
<br /><br />Tickets will be very limited this year and are available for a minimum \"donation\" of $13.37 (see what we did there). All proceeds go to Feed Nova Scotia, because have you seen grocery prices lately?
<br /><br />
We look forward to seeing you in May!"
