statisticsText: "Science communication and outreach that uses English to stretch across global audiences is taking-off in Japan. This event will bring together communicators, writers, scientists, journalists and select experts from abroad to inspire and boost the cohesion of SciCom in Japan. Our goal is to share skills, network and inform the community of the most successful practices in global communication. This is the first meeting of its kind in Japan and aimed at anyone involved or interested in global research communication. This one-day meeting will include keynote talks and panal discussions in the morning on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by research communication within and beyond Japan. Afternoon breakout workshops will provide hands-on training to support communicators and scientists working in Japan as they engage in global outreach. The workshop will be held in English."

statisticsTextJp: "英語による科学広報やアウトリーチといった、科学を伝える活動は、今、日本で活気を帯びています。本イベントは、サイエンスコミュニケーター、サイエンスライター、研究者、ジャーナリストやこの分野の選りすぐりの海外の専門家が一堂に会する場を提供しようとする初めての試みです。国外、特に英語圏へ向けた研究成果の情報発信に携わる全ての人を対象にしています。午前中の基調講演とパネルディスカッションでは、科学や研究成果を題材とした広報や情報発信に特有の課題について、国内にとどまらず、海外の事例を含めて検討します。午後には、複数のグループに別れて、参加者が実際に手を動かして、国外向けの科学広報やアウトリーチの業務に活かせるような実践的なワークショップを行います。本イベントの使用言語は英語です。ジャパン・サイコム・フォーラム2018で、英語による科学広報やアウトリーチのスキルを磨き、横のつながりを作り、互いのベストプラクティスを情報交換しませんか。"

#aboutUs: "Google's services have become synonymous with simple things online. Number of technological innovations and IT industries in which Google is creating new products is enormous. It's hard to get to know all of them, but realistic. This is why people have started to gather in small local groups and share their experience. Later, the following groups have been called Google Developer Groups. GDGs can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch some videos, to large gatherings with demos, tech talks, hackathons and conferences."

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
