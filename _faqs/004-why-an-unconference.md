question: "Why an unconference?"
---

In addition to creating the opportunity to see some good talks, we wanted to create a space for other kinds of sessions, 
particularly ones that require some level of participation or discussion. With so many people working from home because 
of COVID-19, there are many who are craving more human interaction. We want to have MenderCon be a space for that. 
So don’t be surprised to see someone pitch a session that is simply titled something like, “_Let’s chat about the unique 
challenges of refactoring PHP_”, and when you get in the room there are no slides, just someone who wants to facilitate 
a conversation.
