Diversity is essential to a successful SwiftFest Boston 2018. Everyone from volunteers to speakers to organizers have a shared goal of bringing people from underrepresented communities to SwiftFest Boston 2018. We hope to provide a great conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technological choices or experience.

With the help of our generous sponsors SwiftFest Boston 2018 has resources to provide scholarships and stipends for travel-related expenses. If you are an aspiring SwiftFest Boston 2018 attendee requiring financial or logistical assistance then we want to hear from you!

#### On-site Resources
We are doing our best to accommodate all your needs. Here, you can find a list of the resources we are making available to offer everyone a pleasant SwiftFest Boston 2018.

##### Nursing Room
We will be providing a private nursing room at this year’s event to aid in comfort and accessibility for our nursing attendees. The room will be available all days of the event and will be located on-site. For location information, please check with registration or information desk staff on-site.

##### Accessibility
If you need any assistance locating an elevator, or have other questions about accessibility on-site, please speak to a member of the SwiftFest staff on-site. All the accessibility resources are properly marked; however, if you have questions prior to the event, please email us at [conference@swiftfest.io](mailto:conference@swiftfest.io).

##### Quiet Room
All attendees may feel free to use the Quiet Room as needed. It is a physical space where conversation and interaction are not allowed, where attendees can go if for any reason they can’t interact with other attendees at that time.

##### All-Gender Restrooms
We will designate specific restrooms as all-gender restrooms for attendees who feel more comfortable using those facilities.

##### Need Help?
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. If you have any concern about an attendee’s conduct, please refer to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) of the conference.
