  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Sponsors</b> - with your help we can make this event truly awesome! From funding tickets to AngularUP,
      through supplying lunch, to providing swag - lots of opportunities to help.
      <a href="{{ sponsorsUrl }}">Call for Sponsors</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a great impact on the participants' experience.
      If you can volunteer at the workshop and give some support on the days before and after, we'd love to have you!
      You don't need to be an Angular 2 expert - just a web developer.
