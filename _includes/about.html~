            <p>To put it in a nutshell, GDG stands for Google Developer Group and GDG Bangalore it is a community where programmers meet to discuss and work with several Google developer resources and products. </p>
            <p>Our events will always be free and open to the general public. We sometimes co-host an joint event with other communities. In such events, you may get a chance to interact with developers who have already worked with those Google products and services.</p>
