    Are you a woman interested in learning how to build web applications with the latest technologies?
    We have good news for you: We are planning various events around the world for beginners!

  <p>
    We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology.
    We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become a programmer.

    On November 13th, 2016, we held our first event: a one-day workshop, in which selected participants built and
    deployed their very first <b>Angular Web Application!</b> The participants worked in small groups with the
    guidance of dedicated mentors.

    <b>Angular</b> is an open-source platform for building web application, developed by Google and the community.
    It gives various tools to easily create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on browses, mobile, desktop and even
    Arduino!
