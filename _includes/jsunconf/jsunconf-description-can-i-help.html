  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a great impact on the participants' experience.
      If you can volunteer at the workshop and give maybe some support after, we'd love to have you!
      You don't need to be an Angular expert - just a web developer.

    <li>
      <b>Sponsors</b> - with your help we can make our events truly awesome! From granting tickets to JS Unconf, through supplying cool ngGirls goodies - lots of opportunities to help.
