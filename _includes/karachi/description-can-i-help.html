  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a great impact on the participants' experience.
      If you can volunteer at the workshop and give some support on the days before and after, we'd love to have you!
      You don't need to be an Angular expert - just a web developer.
