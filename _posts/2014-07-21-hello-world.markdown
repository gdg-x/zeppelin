We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related event in Porto - [GDG DevFest 2015](http://devfest.gdgporto.xyz/). 

This year event will take place in UPTEC. So take your time to spend weeked in last hidden gem in the Europe in company of experts and technical geeks.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 100 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 12 hours of pure Google technologies 
* **Date**: 17 of October, expect conferences, demos and workshops
* **Venue**: UPTEC - A very nice place to get GDG Porto started.
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers
